# Email Response to Friend

Hi [Friend's Name],

Good news! I've identified and fixed both issues you encountered. I've created a new version (0.1.1) that should resolve everything.

## The Problems

1. **`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ipykernel'`**: The kernel dependencies weren't properly set as required packages. This caused the installation to fail when trying to install the Jupyter kernel.

2. **"Package not found" error**: This was likely caused by the first issue preventing proper installation.

## The Solution

I've released version 0.1.1 with the following fixes:
- Made `ipykernel` and `jupyter` required dependencies (they were optional before)
- Added Python 3.13 support
- Improved error messages

## Installation Steps for You

1. **Uninstall the old version**:
   ```powershell
   pip uninstall open-sas -y
   ```

2. **Install the new version**:
   I'm attaching two files to this email:
   - `open_sas-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl`
   - `open_sas-0.1.1.tar.gz`
   
   Use this command (adjust the path):
   ```powershell
   pip install C:\path\to\open_sas-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

3. **Install the Jupyter kernel**:
   ```powershell
   python -m open_sas.kernel install
   ```
   
   This should work without errors now!

4. **Verify it worked**:
   ```powershell
   python -c "import open_sas; print(open_sas.__version__)"
   ```
   You should see: `0.1.1`

## About Your ODBC Code

I noticed your `.osas` file uses PROC SQL with ODBC pass-through:

```sas
connect to odbc (dsn='OwlConnectLive' user='wd2' password='xxx');
```

**Important**: Open-SAS doesn't currently support ODBC pass-through connections. This is a feature that would need to be added to the PROC SQL implementation.

### Workaround Options:

**Option 1**: Use Python with pyodbc first, then analyze with Open-SAS:
```python
import pyodbc
import pandas as pd

# Connect and get data
conn = pyodbc.connect('DSN=OwlConnectLive;UID=wd2;PWD=xxx')
df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM [OwlConnect_Prod].[dbo].[V_QUERY_GROUPMEMBERDATERANGE]", conn)

# Save for Open-SAS
df.to_parquet('data.parquet')
```

Then in Open-SAS:
```sas
libname mylib '/path/to/data';
proc print data=mylib.data;
run;
```

**Option 2**: Export your data from SQL Server first (to CSV, Parquet, etc.), then use Open-SAS for analysis.

## Files Attached

I'm sending you:
1. `open_sas-0.1.1-py3-none-any.whl` - The installable package
2. `INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed installation and troubleshooting guide

## If You Still Have Issues

Check the INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md file I'm attaching. It has detailed troubleshooting steps for:
- Package not found errors
- Import errors
- Jupyter kernel issues
- Python path problems

Let me know if you hit any snags!

Best,
Ryan

P.S. If you want ODBC support added to Open-SAS, let me know. It's definitely something that could be implemented in a future version.
